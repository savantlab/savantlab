# Mouse Trackpad Science Lab

This project is a science lab environment for recording and analyzing data from the mouse trackpad.

## Goals
- Capture raw trackpad events (position, velocity, gestures, timestamps).
- Store experiment sessions for later analysis.
- Provide tools to visualize and export the collected data.

## Next Steps
- Choose a primary implementation language and framework.
- Implement a small prototype that logs basic trackpad activity to a file.
